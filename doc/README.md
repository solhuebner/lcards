## 📊 Documentation Philosophy

All documentation in this tree reflects the **current state of the code**. Documents are:
- ✅ **Accurate** - Verified against implementation
- ✅ **Complete** - No placeholder sections
- ✅ **Current** - Actively maintained
- ✅ **Clear** - Written for comprehension



---

## 🔄 Documentation Updates

When making code changes:
1. Update relevant documentation files
2. Verify examples still work
3. Update schemas if configuration changed
4. Keep diagrams in sync with code

## 🏗️ Architecture Notes

**Singleton vs Per-Card:**
- **Singletons** (ThemeManager, DataSourceManager, RulesEngine, etc.) are shared across all card instances for maximum efficiency and cross-card coordination
- **Per-card systems** (AnimationManager, MSD SystemsManager) are instantiated once per card for local rendering and animation control
- **CoreSystemsManager** is a singleton used by LCARdS Cards (lcards-button, lcards-chart, etc.)
- **MSD SystemsManager** is per-card, used only by MSD cards, and connects to the core singletons

For detailed architecture information, see [Architecture Overview](./architecture/overview.md) and [Subsystems](./architecture/subsystems/README.md).
