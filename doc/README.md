> **Complete documentation for the LCARdS Home Assistant card system**

## 🏛️ Architecture

LCARdS uses a **singleton-based core architecture** with the following key systems:

| Singleton | Access | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `lcardsCore.themeManager` | ThemeManager | Theme and design tokens |
| `lcardsCore.dataSourceManager` | DataSourceManager | Entity state and data fetching |
| `lcardsCore.rulesManager` | RulesEngine | Conditional styling rules |
| `lcardsCore.validationService` | CoreValidationService | Config validation |
| `lcardsCore.animationRegistry` | AnimationRegistry | Animation caching |
| `lcardsCore.animationManager` | AnimationManager | Animation coordination |

**MSD Overlay Types:** `line` (SVG lines) and `control` (embedded HA cards)

**Key Principle:** Any card can define `data_sources` and `rules` that are registered with global singletons, making them available system-wide for cross-card data sharing.
