## What is LCARdS?

LCARdS is the evolution of dedicated LCARS-inspired cards for Home Assistant.
It originates from, and supersedes the [CB-LCARS](https://github.com/snootched/cb-lcars) project, and is designed to accompany and complement [**HA-LCARS themes**](https://github.com/th3jesta/ha-lcars).

Although deployed and used as individual custom cards, LCARdS is built upon common core components that provide a more complete and cohesive LCARS-like dashboard experience.

- **Unified architecture** — Each LCARd shares core services that centralise data sources, provide a cross-card rules engine, theme tokens, sounds, a coordinated animation framework, and much more.
- **State-aware styling** — Cards respond dynamically to entity states via a rules engine that hot-patches styles across multiple cards simultaneously — including coordinated alert modes.
- **Built to animate** — Embedded Anime.js v4 enables per-element animations on any SVG shape, line, or text — driven by entity state or triggered globally.
- **Living data** — Entities can be subscribed, buffered, and processed (moving averages, min/max, history) and referenced in any card field via a flexible four-syntax template system.
- **Extensible by design** — Themes, button presets, animations, and other assets can be distributed via a content pack system.

## Core Architecture

LCARdS is built on **Lit** web components and embeds **[Anime.js v4](https://animejs.com)** for animations and **[ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com)** for charting. Each LCARd shares a common set of core services that work behind the scenes:

## The Fleet

=== "Button"

    **`lcards-button`** — All standard LCARS buttons, plus advanced multi-segment controls.

    - Built-in preset library: lozenge, bullet, capped, outline, pill, text, and more
    - **Component mode** — embed SVG components (D-pad, Alert, custom shapes) with per-segment interactivity
    - Canvas-based **background animations** — stackable layers with zoom and pan
    - Rules Engine integration — styles hot-patched at runtime

    [Button Documentation](user/cards/button/README.md)

=== "Elbow"

    **`lcards-elbow`** — Classic LCARS corner designs.

    - Built-in presets: `header-left`, `header-right`, `footer-left`, `footer-right`
    - **Simple** and **segmented** (Picard-style double elbow) styles
    - Authentic LCARS arc geometry or diagonal-cut corners with configurable angle
    - Symbiont support — embed other HA cards inside the elbow area

    [Elbow Documentation](user/cards/elbow/README.md)

=== "Slider"

    **`lcards-slider`** — Interactive sliders for display and control.

    - Built-in presets: **pills** (segmented bar) and **gauge** (ruler with tick marks)
    - Horizontal and vertical orientations with independent fill inversion
    - Separate min/max for display range vs. control range
    - Domain auto-detection — interactive for controllable domains, display-only for sensors

    [Slider Documentation](user/cards/slider/README.md)

=== "Data Grid"

    **`lcards-data-grid`** — LCARS data grids with cascade animations.

    - **Data mode** — real entity states, attributes, or template values
    - **Decorative mode** — cascading generated data for aesthetics
    - LCARS-style cascade animation with built-in speed presets
    - CSS Grid layout with full style cascading

    [Data Grid Documentation](user/cards/data-grid/README.md)

    - Animate lines independently with rules

    [MSD Documentation](user/cards/msd/README.md)

=== "Alert Overlay"

    **`lcards-alert-overlay`** — Full-screen dashboard overlay reacting to alert state.

    - Activates automatically on `input_select.lcards_alert_mode` change
    - Full-screen backdrop with blur + tint layers
    - Configurable per-condition content card, position, and size
    - Portal rendering — appended to `document.body` above all HA stacking

    [Alert Overlay Documentation](user/cards/alert-overlay/README.md)

---

## Key Platform Features

=== "🚨 Alert Mode"

    Coordinated dashboard-wide states — more than a colour change:

    - Full palette transform across every dashboard element
    - Sound plays automatically
    - Alert Overlay activates with backdrop and content card
    - Rules-driven per-card animations (opt-in)
    - HA helper stays in sync for automation integration

    Available levels: `green` · `yellow` · `red` · `blue` · `gray` · `black`

    [Alert Mode](core/alert-mode.md)

=== "🔗 Rules Engine"

    Define rules once — apply across many cards simultaneously:

    - Target cards by **type**, **tag**, or **ID**
    - **Patch any style property** — colour, opacity, border, text
    - Changes are **instant and reactive** to entity state
    - Example: turn all `engineering` tagged indicators red when an alarm fires

    [Rules Engine](core/rules/README.md)

=== "📊 DataSource Pipelines"

    Richer data than plain entity state:

    - Subscribe to any HA entity and **buffer values over time**
    - **Processing pipelines** — moving average, min/max, aggregation, custom transforms
    - `{ds:name}` template syntax — charts, labels, sliders, and rules all share one source
    - Stored in browser session; no HA server recording required

    [DataSources](core/datasources/README.md)

=== "🎨 Configuration Studios"

    Immersive UI-based configuration:

    - **Live WYSIWYG** preview with instant feedback
    - **Schema-backed YAML** tab with inline auto-complete and validation
    - **Main Engineering tab** — data sources, rules browser, theme token browser, provenance tracking
    - **Provenance tracking** — see which system contributed each config value at runtime

    [Config Panel](user/config-panel.md)
