## Repository validation commands

These run in CI and are safe to run locally before opening a PR:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run validate:css-vars` | Audits every `--lcars-*`, `--lcards-*`, and `theme:` reference against the allowlists in `scripts/ha-lcars-theme-vars.js` and `src/lcards-vars.js`. Gates `npm run build`. |
| `npm run validate:doc-examples` | Parses every fenced `yaml`/`yml` block in `doc/**.md`, checks that any `type: custom:lcards-*` value matches a registered element, and validates parsed card configs against the real JSON Schemas from `src/cards/schemas/` (7 card types covered; lcards-msd-card excluded). Add `--strict` to promote schema and parse warnings to errors. Two fence meta hints: ` ```yaml alternatives ` skips YAML parsing but still checks type refs; ` ```yaml no-validate ` skips the block entirely. |
| `npm run typecheck` | Runs `tsc` against the JSDoc-typed sources. |
| `npm run docs:build` | Builds the VitePress site. |
