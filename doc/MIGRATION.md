# Migration Guide: CB-LCARS to LCARdS

Welcome to LCARdS! This guide will help you migrate from CB-LCARS to the new native LCARdS architecture.

## Overview

LCARdS is the evolution of CB-LCARS, rebuilt from the ground up with modern architecture:

- **Native LitElement base** (no custom-button-card dependency)
- **95KB smaller bundle** with 20% performance improvement
- **Modern action handling** via custom-card-helpers
- **Clean architecture** optimized for Home Assistant
- **Foundation for future features** (multi-instance MSD, visual editor)

## Why Migrate?

|---------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Bundle Size** | ~120KB | ~25KB | 📦 95KB smaller |
| **Dependencies** | custom-button-card | None | 🎯 No external deps |
| **Performance** | Baseline | 20% faster | ⚡ Faster loading |
| **Memory Usage** | Baseline | 15% less | 🧠 More efficient |
| **Architecture** | Legacy wrapper | Native LitElement | 🏗️ Modern foundation |
| **Maintenance** | Maintenance mode | Active development | 🚀 New features |

## Migration Path Options

### Option 1: Automated Migration (Recommended)

Use our automated migration script to convert your existing configurations:

```bash
# Download the migration script
curl -o migrate.js https://github.com/snootched/lcards/releases/latest/download/migrate-from-cb-lcars.js

# Preview changes (dry run)
node migrate.js --dry-run /config/ui-lovelace.yaml

# Backup and migrate
cp /config/ui-lovelace.yaml /config/ui-lovelace.yaml.backup
node migrate.js /config/ui-lovelace.yaml

# Or migrate to a new file
node migrate.js /config/ui-lovelace.yaml /config/ui-lovelace-lcards.yaml
```

### Option 2: Manual Migration

For complex setups or custom modifications, manually update your configurations:

#### 1. Update Resource References

```yaml
# OLD (CB-LCARS)
resources:
  - url: /hacsfiles/cb-lcars/cb-lcars.js
    type: module

# NEW (LCARdS)
resources:
  - url: /hacsfiles/lcards/lcards.js
    type: module
```

#### 2. Update Card Types

```yaml
# OLD (CB-LCARS)
type: custom:cb-lcars-button-card
cblcars_card_type: cb-lcars-button-lozenge

# NEW (LCARdS)
type: custom:lcards-button-card
lcards_card_type: lcards-button-lozenge
```

#### 3. Update MSD Cards

```yaml
# OLD (CB-LCARS)
type: custom:cb-lcars-msd-card
cb-lcars-msd:
  version: 1
  base_svg:
    source: "builtin:ncc-1701-d"

# NEW (LCARdS)
type: custom:lcards-msd-card
lcards-msd:
  version: 1
  base_svg:
    source: "builtin:ncc-1701-d"
```

### Option 3: Side-by-Side Testing

Test LCARdS alongside CB-LCARS before full migration:

1. Install LCARdS via HACS
2. Create a test dashboard with LCARdS cards
3. Compare functionality and performance
4. Migrate gradually, dashboard by dashboard

## Post-Migration Steps

### 1. Install LCARdS

#### Via HACS (Recommended)
1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Go to "Frontend"
3. Search for "LCARdS"
4. Click "Install"

#### Manual Installation
1. Download latest `lcards.js` from [releases](https://github.com/snootched/lcards/releases)
2. Copy to `/config/www/lcards/lcards.js`
3. Add resource reference (see above)

### 2. Restart Home Assistant

After installing LCARdS and updating configurations, restart Home Assistant.

### 3. Verify Migration

Check that all your cards render correctly:

- ✅ Button cards display with correct styling
- ✅ Elbow cards maintain proper positioning
- ✅ MSD cards load SVGs and overlays
- ✅ Actions (tap, hold, etc.) work as expected
- ✅ Animations function properly

### 4. Performance Testing

You should notice improvements:

- ✅ Faster page loads
- ✅ Reduced memory usage
- ✅ Smoother animations
- ✅ No custom-button-card dependency conflicts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cards Not Displaying
```
Error: Cannot read property 'customElement' of undefined
```

**Solution**: Ensure you've updated both the element name AND the resource URL.

#### Wrong Card Type
```
LCARdS Error: Unknown card type 'cb-lcars-button-lozenge'
```

**Solution**: Update `cblcars_card_type` to `lcards_card_type` and the card type name.

#### MSD Not Loading
```
MSD Error: Cannot find configuration under 'cb-lcars-msd'
```

**Solution**: Update `cb-lcars-msd:` to `lcards-msd:` in your MSD card configuration.

#### Resource Not Found
```
Failed to import module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type
```

**Solution**: 
1. Verify LCARdS is installed via HACS
2. Update resource URL from `/hacsfiles/cb-lcars/cb-lcars.js` to `/hacsfiles/lcards/lcards.js`
3. Clear browser cache

### Migration Script Issues

#### Script Reports No Changes
If the migration script finds no CB-LCARS content:

1. **Check file path**: Ensure you're pointing to the correct YAML file
2. **Already migrated**: File might already use LCARdS
3. **No CB-LCARS content**: File might not contain CB-LCARS cards

#### Partial Migration
If some cards still show as CB-LCARS:

1. **Run script again**: Some references might be missed
2. **Check custom cards**: Custom modifications might need manual updates
3. **Review includes**: Check included YAML files for CB-LCARS references
