/**
 * @fileoverview LCARdS Built-in Images Pack
 *
 * Registers named image assets (raster and SVG) that cards can reference with the
 * `builtin:<key>` syntax in any `source` field — e.g. config.source: 'builtin:bedroom'.
 *
 * This pack uses the AssetManager `image` type, which is a URL-only registry.
 * No content is fetched by AssetManager; the browser loads the image natively via
 * ImageLoader when a card first renders.
 *
 * ## Adding curated images
 *
 * 1. Copy the image file to `hacsfiles/lcards/images/` (mirrored from `src/assets/images/`)
 * 2. Add an entry below with a stable snake_case key and a `/hacsfiles/lcards/images/` URL.
 * 3. The key becomes the `builtin:<key>` reference users put in card config.
 *
 * ## User-defined images
 *
 * Users can add their own entries at runtime from the Config Panel (Settings →
 * Image Library).  Those entries call `assetManager.register('image', key, null, { url })`
 * directly and are persisted in HA storage alongside rules / datasources.
 *
