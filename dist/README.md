## What is LCARdS?

LCARdS is the evolution of dedicated LCARS-inspired cards for Home Assistant.
<br>It originates from, and supercedes the  [CB-LCARS](https://github.com/snootched/cb-lcars) project - and is meant to accompany [**HA-LCARS themes**](https://github.com/th3jesta/ha-lcars).
<br>Although deployed and used as individual custom cards - it's built upon common core components that aim to provide a **more complete and cohesive LCARS-like dashboard experience.**

- **Unified architecture** - Every card has access to centralized data sources with entity subcription and notification, cross-card rules, and unified actions.
- **Studio editors** - Most cards now have dedicated editing studio interfaces with live previews - augmented with schema-backed yaml editors for context-aware autocomplete and validation.
- **Extensible design** - Content can be enhanced and distrbuted (future) via content packs - adding button types, sliders styles, animation definitions, and more.

<br>

## Feature Parity with CB-LCARS

If coming from CB-LCARS, use this table to quickly see what the equivalent card/feature is in LCARdS.  Not all features and functions may be available yet, but will be added over time.


Legend:  ✅ Present | ❌ Not present | ⚠️ Partial

| Feature | CB-LCARS | LCARdS | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Buttons | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-button-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-button` | Builtin `preset` collection provides the standard LCARS buttons which are completely configurable. |
| Multi-Segment Buttons | ❌ | ✅ <br>`lcards-button` | Allows for complex card designs (`component`) to be used as advanced multi-segment/multi-touch controls.  The controls are configured with use of new `segements` configurations. |
| DPAD  | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-dpad-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-button` | First advanced button to use `component` feature of `lcards-button` card. |
| ALERT | ⚠️ <br>background animation | ✅ <br>`lcards-button` | Promoted to a button card component - allows full interactive configurations. |
| Labels | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-label-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-button` | Label functionality can by used with `lcards-button`.  Addional presets available for text labels with or without decoration. |
| Elbows | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-elbow-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-elbow` | Equivalent in LCARdS - enhanced with more corner styles (ie. straight cut with configurable angles) |
| Double Elbows | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-double-elbow-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-elbow` | Double Elbow functionality is now consolidated into a single unified `lcards-elbow` card.  Available elbow styles will allow for double mode if supported. |
| Sliders | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-multimeter-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-slider` | Completely replacing former multimeter card.  Enhanced with much better configuration options for direction, inversion, display min/max, control min/max etc. |
| Cascade Data Grid | ⚠️ <br>background animation | ✅ `lcards-data-grid` | CB-LCARS provided decorative only version as background animation.  <br><br>In LCARdS, `lcards-data-grid` is full featured tabular/cell-based grid that can show real entity data, text, etc.  It still supports a decorative mode (generated data) equivalent to CB-LCARS version if desired.  |
| Charts / Graphs | ❌ | ✅ <br>`lcards-chart` | Embedded ApexCharts library providing access to a variety of charts/graphs types to plot entity/data against. |
| MSD (Master Systems Display) Card | ❌ | ✅ <br>`lcards-msd` | Full MSD system in a card.  Embed controls (other HA cards), connect and route lines, add animations to reflect statuses, etc. |
| Background Animations | ✅ <br>GRID, ALERT, GEO Array, Pulsewave| ⚠️ |GRID (enhanced)<br><br>ALERT (now a button card component like DPAD)<br><br>GEO Array, Pulsewave (pending) |
| Element Animations | ❌ | ✅ | Embedded Anime.js v4 library enabling capability to animate any SVG element (cards, lines/stroke, text, etc.) |
| Symbiont (embedded cards) | ✅ | ❌ | Not yet implmented. |
| State-based Styling / Custom States | ✅ | ✅✅ | CB-LCARS has a limited set of states to control styles.  LCARdS uses both common state groupings [`default`|`active`|`inactive`|`unavailable`] and the ability to definte any state to the list for customized styling.  Integrates with core rules engine for hot-patching card styles. |
| Sounds | ❌ | ✅ | Customizable sounds enabled for many UI and Card event types (tap, double tap, hold, hover, sidebar expand/collapse, and more...) |

## LCARdS Features and Design

### 🎯 Unified Architecture & Core Systems
- LCARdS is built on Lit — moving away from the custom-button-card base of CB-LCARS.
- LCARdS integrates popular libraries: **[ApexCharts](https://apexcharts.com)** for charting and **[Anime.js v4](https://animejs.com)** for animations.
- The cards share a set of common core systems:
  - **Systems Manager** — centralized entity subscriptions and smart card notifications (reducing duplicate subscriptions on the same entities)
  - **Rules Engine** — centralized conditional styling and cross-card behaviors; target cards by tags, types, or IDs
  - **Theme Manager** — token-based theming; themes define colors, spacing, borders, and more
  - **Animation Framework** — fully integrated Anime.js v4 with helper methods and a built-in preset library
  - **DataSource Manager** — centralized data buffers with runtime entity history and processing pipelines (moving average, min/max, aggregation, etc.)
  - **Sound System** — LCARS-style audio feedback for card interactions and UI events; configurable per event type
  - **Pack Manager** — content distribution system for themes, presets, animations, and assets
- **Template system** — four syntaxes supported in any text field: JavaScript `[[[...]]]`, Jinja2 `{{...}}`, token `{entity.state}`, and DataSource `{ds:name}`

### 🎨 Visual Editors
- Card editors have been upgraded with immersive configuration studios.
- Live WYSIWYG configuration with instant preview.
- Schema-backed YAML editing with inline auto-complete and validation for all card options.
- **Main Engineering tab** — per-card access to data sources, rules, theme browser, and provenance tracking.
- Provenance tracking — inspect the effective runtime config and see which system contributed each value.

## Card Editors and Configuration Studios

The aim is for LCARdS to have as much UI-based configuration as it can - but also to be easy to learn and navigate.  Of course, YAML is always available - and UI-editors have a schema-enhanced YAML editing tab to help with validation and auto-complete.


Above the standard HA editor - some cards feature a more immersive graphical environment — *Configuration Studio*. You can use these editors to quickly get set up and out of spacedock.


> [!TIP]
> Look for the ***[Open Configuration Studio]*** launcher button in the card's main configuration tab.

## LCARdS Config Panel

The **LCARdS Config Panel** is a standalone sidebar entry in Home Assistant — a central hub for managing LCARdS settings outside of any individual card editor.

> [!TIP]
> See the [Installation](#installation) section above for the one-time `configuration.yaml` setup required to enable the sidebar panel.

| Tab | What it does |
|-----|--------------|
| **Helpers** | Create all required HA input helpers in one click (sound, alert, HA-LCARS sizing) |
| **Theme Browser** | Browse all live theme tokens and CSS variables from LCARdS and HA-LCARS |
| **Sound** | Configure the active sound scheme and set per-event overrides |
| **Pack Explorer** | Browse installed packs; view available presets, themes, and animations |
| **YAML Export** | Generate a full `configuration.yaml` snippet for all LCARdS helpers |

Alert mode (red/yellow alert) can also be triggered from the Config Panel — it coordinates animated responses across all registered cards simultaneously.

## Built to Extend

LCARdS design is aiming to have an extensbile architecture that can enable **customization and community contribution** by way of a *pack system*.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Packs are content distribution units** containing any combination of: `themes`, `style_presets`, `animations`, `rules`, `svg_assets`, `font_assets`, and future types.
- **Single packs can contain multiple content types** (e.g., lcars_buttons has both style_presets and components)
- **PackManager orchestrates the merge and distribution** at core initialization - registering content to appropriate managers
- **Cards consume from managers**, not packs directly — enabling clean separation from the cards
- **Community extensibility** — custom packs will be able to extend LCARdS with new themes, button styles, animations, and more

## AI Usage

<details>
<summary>AI-Assisted Development Notice (AIG‑2)</summary>

<i>This project is heavily developed with the assistance of AI tools.  Most implementation code and portions of the documentation were generated by AI models.
<br>All architectural decisions, design direction, integration strategy, and project structure are human-led.
<br>AI-generated components are reviewed, validated/tested, and refined by human contributors to ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency with project standards.

This is a human-directed, AI-assisted project. AI acts as an implementation accelerator; humans remain responsible for decisions, testing for quality control, and final output.</i>
</details>

<br>
This project is as much as an experimentation with various AI-enabled tools and learning about different software designs as it is about the creation of the actual custom cards.

<br>
Different models are used throughout the process to plan, create, and (ultimately) refactor the cards and systems.  As we gain more experience, and develop more ideas, then systems are revisited.  We attempt to further standardize, simplify, and optimize where we can as we go.
