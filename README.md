## What is LCARdS?

LCARdS is the next evolution of dedicated LCARS-inspired cards for Home Assistant.
<br>It originates from, and supercedes the  [CB-LCARS](https://github.com/snootched/cb-lcars) project - and is meant to accompany [**HA-LCARS themes**](https://github.com/th3jesta/ha-lcars).
<br>Although deployed and used as individual custom cards - it's built upon common core components that aim to provide a **more complete and cohesive LCARS-like dashboard experience.**

- **Unified architecture** - Every card has access to centralized data sources with entity subcription and notification, cross-card rules, and unified actions.
- **Studio editors** - Most cards now have dedicated editing studio interfaces with live previews - augmented with schema-backed yaml editors for context-aware autocomplete and validation.
- **Extensible design** - Content can be enhanced and distrbuted (future) via content packs - adding button types, sliders styles, animation definitions, and more.

<br>

## Feature Parity with CB-LCARS

If coming from CB-LCARS, use this table to quickly see what the equivalent card/feature is in LCARdS.  Not all features and functions may be available yet, but will be added over time.


Legend:  ✅ Present | ❌ Not present | ⚠️ Partial

| Feature | CB-LCARS | LCARdS | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Button Card | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-button-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-button` | Builtin `preset` collection provides the standard LCARS buttons which are completely configurable. |
| Multi-Segment Buttons | ❌ | ✅ <br>`lcards-button` | Allows for complex SVGs (`component`) to be used as advanced multi-segment/multi-touch controls.  The controls are configured with use of new `segements` configurations. |
| D-PAD Card | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-dpad-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-button` | First advanced button to use `component` feature of `lcards-button` card. |
| Label Card | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-label-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-button` | Label functionality can by used with `lcards-button`.  Addional presets available for text labels with or without decoration. |
| Elbow Card | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-elbow-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-elbow` | Equivalent in LCARdS - enhanced with more corner styles (ie. straight cut with configurable angles) |
| Double Elbow Card | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-double-elbow-card` | ✅ <br>`lcards-elbow` | Double Elbow functionality is now consolidated into a single unified `lcards-elbow` card.  Available elbow styles will allow for double mode if supported. |
| Slider Card | ✅ <br>`cb-lcars-multimeter-card` | ⚠️ <br>`lcards-slider` | Completely replacing former multimeter card.  Enhanced with much better configuration options for direction, inversion, display min/max, control min/max etc.  Picard-style slider pending. |
| Cascade Data Grid | ⚠️ | ✅ `lcards-data-grid` | CB-LCARS provided decorative only version as background animation.  <br><br>In LCARdS, `lcards-data-grid` is full featured tabular/cell-based grid that can show real entity data, text, etc.  It still supports a decorative mode (generated data) equivalent to CB-LCARS version if desired.  |
| Chart / Graph Card | ❌ | ✅ <br>`lcards-chart` | Embedded ApexCharts library providing access to a variety of charts/graphs types to plot entity/data against. |
| MSD (Master Systems Display) Card | ❌ | ✅ <br>`lcards-msd` | Full MSD system in a card.  Embed controls (other HA cards), connect and route lines, add animations to reflect statuses, etc. |
| Background Animations | ✅ <br>GRID, ALERT, GEO Array, Pulsewave| ❌ | Not yet implmented. |
| Element Animations | ❌ | ✅ | Embedded Anime.js v4 library enabling capability to animate any SVG element (cards, lines/stroke, text, etc.) |
| Symbiont (embedded cards) | ✅ | ❌ | Not yet implmented. |
| State-based Styling / Custom States | ✅ | ✅✅ | CB-LCARS has a limited set of states to control styles.  LCARdS uses both common state groupings [`default`|`active`|`inactive`|`unavailable`] and the ability to definte any state to the list for customized styling.  Integrates with core rules engine for hot-patching card styles. |

## LCARdS Features and Design

### 🎯 Unified Architecture & Core Systems
- LCARdS is now based on Lit - moving away from the custom-button-card base of CB-LCARS.
- Cards share a set of common core systems:
  - **Systems Manager** - centralized entity subscriptions and smart card notifications (reducing multiple subscriptions on same entities)
  - **Rules Engine** — centralized processing of conditional styling and cross-card behaviors - send updates to multiple cards targetable by tags, types, IDs, etc.
  - **Theme Manager** — token-based theming allowing for themes to define many visual aspects.
  - **Animation Framework** — provides fully integrated anime.js v4 with helper methods and a core set of animation presets.
  - **DataSource Manager** — centralized data buffers providing entity history, transformations and aggregations that can be used for runtime visualizations.
  - ..and more
- Template support (JavaScript, Jinja2, LCARdS tokens)
- Unified action handlers and lifecycle


### 🎨 Visual Editors
- Card editors have been upgraded with immersive configuration studios.
- Live WYSIWGY configuration.
- Schema-backed YAML editing with inline auto-complete for card options.
- Provenance tracking for configuration layer debugging.

## System Architecture

LCARdS is built on a layered architecture that aims keeps cards simple.  The cards leverage the shared core for accessing powerful features:

## Card Editors and Configuration Studios

The aim is for LCARdS to have as much UI-based configuration as it can - but also to be easy to learn and navigate.  Of course, YAML is always available - and UI-editors have a schema-enhanced YAML editing tab to help with validation and auto-complete.


Above the standard HA editor - some cards feature a more immersive graphicalal environment - *Configuration Studio*  You can use these editors to quickly get set up and out of spacedock.


> [!TIP]
> Look for the ***[Open Configuration Studio]*** launcher button in the card's main configuration tab.

## Built to Extend

LCARdS design is aiming to have an extensbile architecture that can enable **customization and community contribution** by way of a *pack system*.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Packs are content distribution units** containing any combination of: `themes`, `style_presets`, `animations`, `rules`, `svg_assets`, `font_assets`, and future types.
- **Single packs can contain multiple content types** (e.g., lcars_buttons has both style_presets and components)
- **PackManager orchestrates the merge and distribution** at core initialization - registering content to appropriate managers
- **Cards consume from managers**, not packs directly — enabling clean separation from the cards
- **Community extensibility** — custom packs will be able to extend LCARdS with new themes, button styles, animations, and more

## AI Usage

<details>
<summary>AI-Assisted Development Notice (AIG‑2)</summary>

<i>This project is heavily developed with the assistance of AI tools.  Most implementation code and portions of the documentation were generated by AI models.
<br>All architectural decisions, design direction, integration strategy, and project structure are human-led.
<br>AI-generated components are reviewed, validated/tested, and refined by human contributors to ensure accuracy, coherence, and consistency with project standards.

This is a human-directed, AI-assisted project. AI acts as an implementation accelerator; humans remain responsible for decisions, testing for quality control, and final output.</i>
</details>

<br>
This project is as much as an experimentation with various AI-enabled tools and learning about different software designs as it is about the creation of the actual custom cards.

<br>
Different models are used throughout the process to plan, create, and (ultimately) refactor the cards and systems.  As we gain more experience, and develop more ideas, then systems are revisited.  We attempt to further standardize, simplify, and optimize where we can as we go.
