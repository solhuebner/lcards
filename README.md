> [!WARNING]
> ## ⚠️ Breaking Change — Integration replaces Frontend Plugin
>
> LCARdS has moved from a **HACS Frontend Plugin** to a **HACS Integration**.
> This is a one-time migration that must be done manually on existing installs.
>
> **If you have an existing LCARdS installation you must:**
> 1. Remove the old **LCARdS** HACS Frontend Plugin (HACS → Frontend → LCARdS → Remove)
> 2. If you added LCARdS as a custom HACS repository, remove that entry too
> 3. Remove the `panel_custom:` block from `configuration.yaml` if you added one
> 4. Restart Home Assistant
> 5. Install **LCARdS** from HACS **Integrations** (not Frontend)
> 6. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Add Integration → LCARdS** to activate it
>

## What is LCARdS?

LCARdS is the evolution of dedicated LCARS-inspired cards for Home Assistant.
It originates from, and supersedes, the [CB-LCARS](https://github.com/snootched/cb-lcars) project. LCARdS is designed to accompany and complement the [**HA-LCARS theme**](https://github.com/th3jesta/ha-lcars).

Each card shares a set of common core services — a unified rules engine, DataSource pipelines, theme tokens, coordinated animations, sounds, and more — providing a cohesive LCARS-like dashboard experience rather than a collection of isolated components.

**Cards included:**
| Card | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `lcards-button` | All standard LCARS buttons plus advanced multi-segment component mode (D-pad, Alert, custom shapes) |
| `lcards-elbow` | LCARS corner designs — simple and Picard-style segmented double elbows |
| `lcards-slider` | Interactive sliders for sensors and controllable entities — pills and gauge styles |
| `lcards-select-menu` | Grid of option buttons built from `input_select`/`select` entities or custom options. |
| `lcards-data-grid` | LCARS tabular grids with real entity data and cascade animation |
| `lcards-chart` | ApexCharts-powered charting with full DataSource pipeline integration |
| `lcards-alert-overlay` | Full-screen dashboard alert backdrop reacting to `input_select.lcards_alert_mode` |
| `lcards-msd` | Master Systems Display — embed any HA cards on a positioned SVG canvas with routed connecting lines |

## Coming from CB-LCARS

LCARdS supersedes CB-LCARS. You can run both side-by-side while transitioning — all new features and fixes are in LCARdS only.

## Installation

[![Open in HACS](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=snootched&repository=LCARdS&category=integration)

1. Open **HACS** → search for **LCARdS** under **Integrations** → Download
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Add Integration → LCARdS**

That's it — no `configuration.yaml` changes required. LCARdS registers its resources and sidebar panel automatically.

There are no external dependencies — use with [**HA-LCARS themes**](https://github.com/th3jesta/ha-lcars) for the full experience.

> **Existing users:** see the breaking change notice above before installing.
