## What is LCARdS?

LCARdS is the next evolution of dedicated LCARS-inspired cards for Home Assistant.
<br>It originates from, and supercedes the  [CB-LCARS](https://github.com/snootched/cb-lcars) project.
<br>Although deployed and used as custom cards - it's built upon common core platform that work to provide a **more complete and cohesive LCARS-like dashboard experience.**

- **Unified architecture** - Every card shares powerful reactivity, cross-card rules, and unified actions
- **Studio editors** - Advanced card editing interfaces with live previews - augmented with schema-backed yaml editors.
- **Extensible design** - Content can be enhanced and distrbuted (future) via content packs - adding button types, sliders styles, animaiton definitions, and more.

<br>

## Feature Parity with CB-LCARS

If coming from CB-LCARS, use this table to quickly see what the equivalent card/feature is in LCARdS.  Not all features and functions may be available yet, but will be added over time.


Legend:  ✅ Present | ❌ Not present | ⚠️ Partial

| Feature | CB-LCARS | LCARdS | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Button Card | ✅ <br>cb-lcars-button-card | ✅ <br>lcards-button | Builtin `preset` collection provides all the standard LCARS buttons. |
| D-PAD Card | ✅ <br>cb-lcars-dpad-card | ✅ <br>lcards-button | Uses new  `component` feature of `lcards-button` card - complex SVGs can be turned into advanced multi-touch controls with use of `segements` concept. |
| Label Card | ✅ <br>cb-lcars-label-card | ✅ <br>lcards-button | Label functionality can by used with `lcards-button`.  Addional presets available for text labels with or without decoration. |
| Elbow Card | ✅ <br>cb-lcars-elbow-card | ✅ <br>lcards-elbow | Equivalent in LCARdS. |
| Double Elbow Card | ✅ <br>cb-lcars-double-elbow-card | ✅ <br>lcards-elbow | Double Elbow now consolidated into a single unified `lcards-elbow` card. |
| Slider Card | ✅ <br>cb-lcars-multimeter-card | ⚠️ <br>lcards-slider | Picard slider missing |
| Cascade Data Grid | ⚠️ | ✅ lcards-data-grid | CB-LCARS provided decorative only version as background animation.  <br><br>In LCARdS, `lcards-data-grid` is full featured tabular/cell-based grid that can show real entity data - but also supports decorative mode equivalent to CB-LCARS version if desired.  |
| Chart / Graph Card | ❌ | ✅ <br>lcards-chart | Embedded ApexCharts library providing access to a variety of charts/graphs types to plot entity/data against. |
| MSD (Master Systems Display) Card | ❌ | ✅ <br>lcards-msd | Full MSD system in a card.  Embed controls (other HA cards), connect and route lines, add animations to reflect statuses, etc. |
| Background Animations | ✅ <br>GRID, ALERT, GEO Array, Pulsewave| ❌ | Not yet implmented. |
| Element Animations | ❌ | ✅ | Embedded Anime.js v4 library enabling capability to animate any SVG element (cards, lines/stroke, text, etc.) |
| Symbiont (embedded cards) | ✅ | ❌ | Not yet implmented. |
| State-based Styling | ✅ | ✅✅ | CB-LCARS has a limited set of states to control styles.  LCARdS uses both common states, but any state can be added to the list for customized styling. |
| Custom States | ✅ | ✅✅ | LCARdS has global 'rules engine providing advanced rules to control changes to cards. |

## LCARdS Features and Design

### 🎯 Unified Architecture & Core Systems
- LCARdS is now based on Lit - moving away from the custom-button-card base of CB-LCARS.
- Cards share a set of common core systems:
  - **Systems Manager** - centralized entity subrcriptions and smart card notifications.
  - **Rules Engine** — conditional styling and cross-card behaviors targetable by tags, types, IDs, etc.
  - **Theme Manager** — token-based theming with live switching
  - **Animation Framework** — anime.js v4 integration for rich effects
  - **DataSource Manager** — entity subscriptions and browser-side transformations
- Template support (JavaScript, tokens, Jinja2)
- Unified action handlers and lifecycle


### 🎨 Visual Editors
- Card editors have been upgraded with immersive configuration studios
- Live WYSIWGY configuration.
- Schema-backed YAML editing with inline auto-complete for card options
- Provenance tracking for configuration layer debugging

## System Architecture

LCARdS is built on a layered architecture that keeps cards simple while providing powerful shared features:

## Editing with Studio

> [!IMPORTANT]
> LCARdS features **immersive, wizard-driven editors** that bring the "Main Engineering" experience to your dashboard configuration.

![Studio Editing Experience](docs/assets/studio-editing-ui.png)
<!--
IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: Studio editor showcase
Show: MSD studio open with:
- Config overlay panel
- Live preview
- Provenance dialog
- Theme selector
- Rules builder visible in background

### What Makes Studio Different?

All LCARdS cards have in-place editors, but advanced cards (like MSD) get the **full Studio experience**:

- **Visual, live editing** - See changes as you make them
- **Schema-driven helpers** - Context-aware inputs and wizards
- **Undo/Redo history** - Never lose your work
- **Provenance tracking** - See who changed what and when
- **Theme live-switching** - Test themes without leaving the editor
- **Main Engineering access** - Global dialogs for rules, alerts, animations

> [!TIP]
> **Edit like a Starfleet engineer.** Studio editors make complex configurations intuitive, powerful features discoverable, and mistakes reversible.
